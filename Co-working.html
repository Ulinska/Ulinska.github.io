            <h3 class="h3-case">What is this app about?</h3>
            <p class="text text-case">
        The app is designed to help people find and schedule places to work remotely from. Main functionalities include searching and sorting by distance and other criteria, setting price ranges. The app ensures flexibility for its users and makes booking and search much shorter.

                  <h3 class="h3-case">Why such an app?</h3>
                  <p class="text text-case">The idea for this project came up to me when I was browsing social media. Many people were looking for a mate to share co-working or studio with. After the pandemic, many companies switched to remote model of work, thus many people started working from home. For many this is a big problem, because of many reasons like noisy flatmates or lack of proper space and equipment. Co-working became very popular in no time. </p>
                <h3 class="h3-case">Steps</h3>
                <p class="text text-case">Here's a quick glance at what will you find in this case study. Pay extra attention to the final design!</p>

<div>
                  <h3 class="h3-case">Problem</h3>
                    <p class="text text-case">There are of course sites and apps similar in nature, but lack usability and essential features. Every place usually has a unique website, and individuals that are looking for someone to share space with usually advertise on social media. The is no app to gather all the offers from companies and individuals. An app like this would make the search and booking much faster and simpler.</p>
                  <h3 class="h3-case">Solution</h3>
                    <p class="text text-case">Research and design a scheduling app for co-working and find out about the most desirable features. </p>
</div>

<div class="grid-2">

              <h3 class="h3-case">Hypotheses and questions</h3>
                <p class="text text-case">Before starting the process, I have come up with few hypotheses. They were my guidance in the project. <br>
                Based on those, I knew what to look for while doing desk research.</p>
   </div>

   <div class="column-1">

<div>
          <h3 class="h3-case">Competitive analyze</h3>
          <img src="img/co-space/Competitors.png" alt="">
          <h3 class="h3-case">Based on that we learned that:</h3>
          <ul class="ul-case">
        <li>Most of them are rather unpopular.</li>
        <li>Some gathered only paid options, other only free ones</li>
        <li>All apps have quite different search options. Some focuses on price, other on place vibes and other even on wi-fi speed</li>
        <li>The UI for most apps are rather old-fashioned</li>
          </ul>

          <h3 class="h3-case">Who are indirect competitors?</h3>
          <p class="text text-case">Besides direct competitors, I also took inspiration from sites like olx, gumtree, booking and others. From those apps I learned what should I include in my design and what is the users mental model for scheduling apps.</p>
          <ul class="ul-case">
          <li>Advance search with many sorting options</li>
          <li>Recommendations based on previous searches</li>
          <li>Paid recommended offers can be a good way to finance the app</li>
          <li>There should be a way to cancel a reservation without being “punished” for that</li>
          <li>Extra stuff like articles and newsletters and tips can be a great way to engage users into checking app more</li>
          </ul>

          <h3 class="h3-case">User interviews</h3>
          <p class="text text-case">I conducted interviews with 4 individuals. All of them had experience in working from home and were interested in renting co-working spaces. <br>
           Main questions I asked included:</p>
          <ul class="ul-case">
          <li>How old are you?</li>
          <li>What type of work do you do?</li>
          <li>What does your typical day at work looks like?</li>
          <li>Do you work from home or office or somewhere else? Which one do you prefer</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="text text-case">Co-working related:</p>
          <ul class="ul-case">
          <li>Why or why not you are interested in renting co-working spaces?</li>
          <li>Do you have any experience with co-working?</li>
          <li>Have you ever searched for co-working online? What was it like</li>
          <li>Did coronavirus change the way you look at remote work?</li>
          <li>What do you think are the strong and weak points of coworking and open space?</li>
          </ul>

          <h3 class="h3-case">Extra research on social media</h3>
          <p class="text text-case">I felt like with only 4 participants, we aren’t getting enough insights and diverse opinion. That’s why I got engaged in r/digitalnomad community with over 1.6 million redditors.<br>Here are links to some of the most interesting threads: </p>

            <h3 class="h3-case">What are the pain points?</h3>
            <p class="text text-case">Based on that, I established three main pain points that should be the vital point for brand communication. We need to people believe that it doesn't have to be like that.</p>
            <ul class="ul-case">
            <li>The image of co-working and renting offices in general seems uninviting and hard. People are scared of financial commitment. Many don’t even try, because they assume it's expensive</li>
            <li>Many people don’t like socializing and take it as disadvantage. They do not see a point int meeting new people from the field (or just inspiring people in general) and don’t like networking.</li>
            <li>People feel that renting a desk at co-working or sharing a studio with someone is the same as renting a flat or house. They see to much commitment and not enough advantage.</li>
